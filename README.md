Rainfall Prediction is the application of meteorology and machine learning to predict the rainfall by looking the atmospheric features. It is important to exactly determine the rainfall for effective use of water resources, crop productivity and pre-planning of water structures.
Moreover, rainfall greatly affects human life in various sectors such as agriculture and transportation. Additionally, it can cause natural disasters such as drought, floods, and landslides. The aim of this project is to build an accurate rainfall prediction model so that prescriptive measures can be made.
Governments, communities and individuals spend large amounts of money so that there is enough water available for everyone. Collecting and understanding rainfall data is important so that the right decisions are made.
